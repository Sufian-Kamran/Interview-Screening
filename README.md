An interview screening website built using React Js and Tailwind Css for frontend and Node js and Express Js for backend along with MongoDB Compass for database.
The questionnaire are displayed on the left side and a webcam is displayed on right. After clicking on the start recording button the webcam starts recording and a count-down starts.
After the timer hits zero or the user clicks stops recording, the webcam stops recording and a preview video is made available to see.
The user can either re-record the video or submit the video, which would be stored in the uploads folder in the backend and video path will be saved in MongoDB.
